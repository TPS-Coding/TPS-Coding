- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, This is the GitHub page for the Python Coding Course offered at Tuxedo Park School
- This is where you will find code written by each student.
- Some games require graphics to run. These graphics are licensed through CraftPix and only for student use.

- ## Please go to https://www.thebearcode.com for more info and to play some of the games!
  
  ### Please email me at TPScoding@tuxedoparkschool.org if your child would like his/her game graphics.
